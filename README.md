# HashTable and Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This repository contains simple Java implementations of a HashTable and a Binary Search Tree (BST).

### HashTable

An efficient associative array mapping keys to values. Utilizes a hash function to compute indexes for quick value retrieval. Supports key-value pairs with insertion, retrieval, deletion, and existence checking.

### Binary Search Tree (BST)

A binary tree structure with each node having at most two children: left and right. Follows the binary search property for efficient key-value storage. Enables insertion, retrieval, deletion, and iteration over key-value pairs.
